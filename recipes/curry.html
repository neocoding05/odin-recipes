    <h2>Description</h2>
<p>Japan is a well known country, something lesser known is the amazing curry it has to offer.</p>
<p>This will be the recipe my mother always used to make, sadly not from scratch.</p>
<p>For me, it reminds me of home, a mouthful of love and a belly filled.</p>
<p>It has a savory taste to it and a creamy texture. I hope you'll love the recipe as much as I do.</p>
