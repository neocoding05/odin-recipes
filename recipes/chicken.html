    <h1>Chicken Dish</h1>

    <img src="../photos/chicken.jpg">
    <p>The reason why I called this "Chicken Dish", is due to the fact</p>
    <p>that I just used to make this when younger and never gave it a name.</p>
    <p>The recipe itself is upto interpretation, so you can deviate from the recipe.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Its a recipe with a lot of flavour, nice to add some rice to it. </p>
        <p>Its really simple and mostly uses the flavour combination of simple ingredients.</p>

        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>        
            <li>300 gr Chicken</li>
            <li>One large onion</li>
            <li>Two small tomatoes</li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>Preferred seasoning, including salt</li>
            <li>Rice</li>
        </ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>

    <li>Cut your chicken and tomato into pieces</li>
    <li>Procceed to throw your onions into a pan on medium heat</li>
    <li>Add the garlic while maintaining a stir so nothing burns</li>
    <li>After everything looks a little glazed out, you add your tomato</li>
    <li>You lower the heat and let it simmer, but first procceed to add your chicken and spices</li>  
    <li>If you see it doesnt have enough water to simmer, add a little water to it, not too much as it takes away from the taste.</li>

    <li>Now enjoy</li>
